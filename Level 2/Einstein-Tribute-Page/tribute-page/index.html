                            This outspoken nature of Faraz caused him quite of troubles in life. He admired Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto very much as a politician. He was very much active during the student and labor movement held during the 1960s.  He was not much fond of military rule. He felt heartbroken for the atrocities that the people of East Pakistan faced at the hands of Pakistani military. He dared to call the Pakistan Army as “professional killers” due to their brutalities in East Pakistan. Even in his poems and writings he severely criticized military regime for this reason, during a mushaira held while Zia-ul-Haq was in power. As a result, Ahmed Faraz was arrested. After this incident he left Pakistan and moved to Europe and Canada. After six years he returned to Pakistan. Even during the regime of General Parvez Musharraf he issued statements regarding the former dictator’s policies in Baluchistan that made the dictator cross. As a result the government drove out the poet and his family from their home in the capital city of Islamabad. Their belongings were thrown onto the road. In the year of 2007, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz removed the poet from the post that he occupied as the chairman of the National Book Council. In 2006 he even returned his Hilal-e-Imtiaz which was awarded to him in 2004.
